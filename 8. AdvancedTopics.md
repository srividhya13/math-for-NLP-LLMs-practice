# Optional but Advanced Topics

> These topics go **beyond typical LLM/ML engineer roles** but are essential for deeper **theoretical research**, **paper implementation**, and **PhD-level work** in AI/ML/NLP.

### Topics:

- **Measure Theory**  
  For rigorous definitions of probability, expectations, and integrals in continuous spaces.  
  _Useful in understanding Bayesian inference, continuous distributions, and limits of neural network generalization._

- **Topology**  
  Understands the shape and properties of high-dimensional spaces used in embeddings, manifolds, and continuity in neural networks.  
  _Helpful in understanding latent space structure, t-SNE/UMAP, and vector similarity._

- **Differential Geometry**  
  Studies smooth curves and surfaces â€” important in analyzing loss surfaces and optimization landscapes in deep learning.  
  _Critical for research in Riemannian optimization, manifold learning, and advanced generalization theory._
